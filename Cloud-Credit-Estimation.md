<h1> Cloud Credit Estimation </h1>

<h2> NHGRI Analysis and Visualization Lab-space (AnVIL) </h2>

* [Controlling cloud costs](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/sections/360006459511-Controlling-Cloud-costs) – Understand the costs of using key cloud services (Google Cloud Storage, Google Compute Engine, and Google BigQuery). Examples help you make informed decisions around controlling costs on Terra.
* [Link your Terra identity with Google Billing](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360026182251-How-to-set-up-billing-projects-and-Google-Billing-Accounts) – The Terra platform is free to use; you can browse showcase workspaces and the Data Library as soon as you register. However, operations in Terra (workflows, Jupyter Notebooks, data access/storage) may incur GCP charges billed through your Terra billing account.
* [Preparing a Cloud Cost Budget Justification](https://anvilproject.org/learn/control-cloud-costs/budget-templates) – Walks you through creating a budget justification paragraph for a grant proposal with information on Understanding GCP Fees, Estimating Cloud Costs, and Preparing a Budget Justification.
